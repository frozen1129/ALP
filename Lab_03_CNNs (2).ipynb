    "Have you ever wondered how your phone recognizes your face, or how self-driving cars \"see\" pedestrians? The secret lies in **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** - a breakthrough that revolutionized computer vision. In this lab, you'll not just learn about CNNs, you'll build one from scratch, watch it learn to recognize objects, and even peek inside its \"brain\" to see what it's thinking!\n",

    "- **Visual understanding**: See what your CNN is actually learning through filter visualization\n",
    "- **Real-world performance**: Achieve >80% accuracy on CIFAR-10 image classification\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 Your Lab Philosophy\n",

    "# Part 2: CNN Architecture - Building Your Visual Cortex 🧠\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Human brains have a visual cortex with specialized neurons for detecting edges, shapes, and eventually complex objects. CNNs work the same way! Early layers detect simple patterns (edges, colors), middle layers detect parts (eyes, wheels), and deep layers detect full objects (cats, cars).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight**: CNNs use **parameter sharing** through convolutional filters. Instead of learning separate weights for every pixel position (like fully-connected layers), they learn reusable filters that detect patterns anywhere in the image. This is why CNNs work so well for images!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you'll build a modern CNN architecture with:\n",
    "- Convolutional layers (feature extractors)\n",
    "- Batch normalization (training stabilizer)\n",
    "- Pooling layers (spatial reduction)\n",
    "- Dropout (overfitting prevention)\n",
    "- Fully-connected head (final classification)"

    "## Understanding CNN Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Building Blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convolutional Layers** (`nn.Conv2d`)\n",
    "   - Extract features using learnable filters\n",
    "   - Parameters: `in_channels`, `out_channels`, `kernel_size`\n",
    "   - Example: `nn.Conv2d(3, 64, kernel_size=3)` → 3 input channels (RGB), 64 output features, 3×3 filters\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Batch Normalization** (`nn.BatchNorm2d`)\n",
    "   - Normalizes activations for stable training\n",
    "   - Dramatically improves convergence speed\n",
    "   - Always use after Conv layers!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Activation Functions** (`F.relu`)\n",
    "   - Introduces non-linearity (essential for learning complex patterns)\n",
    "   - ReLU is the standard choice: `f(x) = max(0, x)`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Pooling Layers** (`F.max_pool2d`)\n",
    "   - Reduces spatial dimensions (downsampling)\n",
    "   - Makes model more robust to small translations\n",
    "   - Common: 2×2 max pooling (reduces size by 50%)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Dropout** (`nn.Dropout`)\n",
    "   - Randomly zeros out neurons during training\n",
    "   - Prevents overfitting by forcing redundancy\n",
    "   - Typical rate: 0.25-0.5\n",

    "1. **Training dynamics**: What do you observe about the relationship between training and validation curves? Is there overfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Your answer:* During training, both training and validation losses decrease steadily, and validation accuracy generally follows the same upward trend as training accuracy.In later epochs, the training loss may continue to decrease while validation performance plateaus or slightly fluctuates, which suggests the early signs of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",

    "2. **Learning rate schedule**: How does the learning rate change over time? Why might this help training?\n",

    "*Your answer:* With cosine annealing, the learning rate gradually decreases over the course of training.As training progresses, the lower learning rate enables finer adjustments, helping the model converge more smoothly to a better minimum.\n",

    "3. **Early stopping**: Did early stopping trigger? What does this tell you about your model's learning?\n",
